## Synopsis

Hey everyone, this is future Chase just here to remind you that this is part 2 of our Playing with Power episode discussing the September 1991 Nintendo Power issue. If you missed part one, you might want to go and listen to the previous episode first before diving in. Oh, and I looked it up and Monty Mole DID debut in Super Mario World, in case you were curious. Alright, with that out of the way, letâ€™s get back to the show.

Hey everyone. Welcome back! It's time for the second part of Playing with Power for September 1991's issue of Nintendo Power. We talked about a lot of Mario World last week. This week we're talking about a whole lot of stuff. We've got Game Boy stuff (like Final Fantasy Adventure), NES stuff (like Kick Master), and more SNES stuff (like Castlevania.) There is so much stuff. Emmy talks about her encounter with American Gladiators, Chase ponders if anyone from The Simpsons actually signed off on Bart Simpson's "interview", and there's even some POGs in there. Er... sorry, they're "milk caps". POGs is a registered trademark. You won't wanna miss all this, come listen and feel free to follow along!
